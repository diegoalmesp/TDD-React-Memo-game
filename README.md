# TDD-React-Memo-game
Created with CodeSandbox

# Description

This is a small "Simon says" type of game to test the new [React Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html).

I used TDD, Jest, react-testing-library and of course the new Alpha versions of React and ReactDOM

Feel free to improve the code and update the tests if you do.
